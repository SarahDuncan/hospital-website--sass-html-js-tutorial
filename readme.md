# HTML, SASS & JavaScript Responsive Website Tutorial

I completed a YouTube tutorial on building a responsive website using HTML, SASS, and JavaScript. The tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvKL_i8A1N8). This tutorial helped me practice and improve my SASS/SCSS skills. I have just learned SASS and wanted to put it together with HTML & JavaScript. I created a one-page static website for a hospital as part of this tutorial. It was an enjoyable experience and helped me develop my frontend development skills.
